### MacOS

When using Docker on MacOS you will need to run it in a Virtual Environment as Docker only runs on Linux based systems. Thankfully there is a rather simple way to achieve this using VirtualBox, Vagrant, Boot2Docker and the Docker Client.

Follow the steps described [here](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html) to install Vagrant and these steps [here](http://docs.docker.io/installation/mac/) to install docker on MacOS.

### Ubuntu

Because Docker runs natively on Linux based systems, setting it up on Ubuntu is rather easy. Follow the instructions [here](http://docs.docker.io/installation/ubuntulinux/).
